<p>title: the first readers? style: clarity —</p>
<p>after some years of existance, today this blog had its first readers, or at least i hope so, as two frriends asked me about it and i sent them the link.</p>
<p>this marks a watershed for this blog that i had abandoned. if i really had some readers they were the first ones, but how to know that it really happened?</p>
<p>my preferred way to know is to receive some feedback from them, but is this blog receptive to feedback?</p>
<p>this blog’s only support for feedback is providing contact details. this is not welcoming to readers. i can add a disqus panel in order to make it easier for readers to comment. i added the task to my stack.</p>
<p>anyway, they already gave me feedback with their interest, and the result is that i’m updating this blog, thus interrupting the process of abandonment.</p>
