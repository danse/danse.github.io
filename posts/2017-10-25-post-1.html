<p>while i start expanding and freeing my routine, i still feel the constraints of the routines that until yesterday were enforced</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>the stress of August is like a crack in my story, a place where an object impacted on my system. some broken parts extend until now, the others are just memories that reveal me something new</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>culture, society and expectations lead to rigidities even when one is remote or nomading. i always knew it, but maybe not so clearly. i wanted to challenge it and i did it</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>i was able to force things through my pain</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>i cannot freely stop that movement, now it has its own momentum, i have to let it end</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>moving alone in the dark i finally broke</p>
<p>my old corporate glasses made of steel and advanced technology. i used to like them, besides the logo that was too visible. they were discrete but with personality, robust, flexible, convenient, a bit magic, they tried to pretend they weren’t there</p>
<p>it’s time to get some new ones</p>
<p>less expensive, less shiny, less metallic, more visible and common, maybe more fragile, suited to an healthier life and inspired by a friend</p>
