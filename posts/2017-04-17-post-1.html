<p>A feature of code is that it unifies knowledge. Through its language, through it symbols, it brings us to fit knowledge into a common structure.</p>
<p>I now have a lot of “meta” issues on Github, issues which could lead to the creation of a repo. Prioritising them is becoming challenging. My intuition needs to be driven by an overview of the possibilities and the constraints.</p>
<p>Also, i have online issues and offline issues, and i don’t have a system to publish or download them in bulk.</p>
<p>I could write some code, some software, to help me out. But i need it to start from level zero of sophistication, i want the system to be in place before the software, so that i can develop the software in a way that is sustainable for me given my small availability of time.</p>
<p>Medusa is already my barebones system for managing tasks, even though its functionalities are extremely limited at the moment. I can turn my <code>meta</code> repo into a directory with Medusa files for now, which will allow offline operativeness and online sharing. From there i can keep developing on Medusa.</p>
<p>The other similar tool i find online is <a href="https://github.com/damianfral/th"><code>th</code></a>, but it doesn’t seem actively maintained. I got in touch with its author</p>
