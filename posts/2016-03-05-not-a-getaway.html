<p>I spent a lot of energies to have it really clear, that this is not a getaway, that i am giving something valuable away in order to come back to Sicily and do something good for my country of origin.</p>
<p>Yet, this sounds so crazy even to myself, that despite evidence i need to keep stating it again and again.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t like to lose all the good experiences, relationships, opportunities, and the many other resources this city offers me. But what would the future of southern Italy be, if everybody opted to move to a different place, were living is easier? My relatives, my region and my country invested in me to make me grow healthy, knowledgeable and skilled. Should i just ignore their altruism, and go spend the result of this investment elsewhere?</p>
<p>No, i won’t.</p>
<p>I will try, try at least, to give back.</p>
<p>Still, i still have a bit of time before saying goodbye to Berlin. I still have some time to keep repeating myself that it would be convenient, and sensible, to stay here. I will keep repeating myself that as funny as it sounds, in this world ruled by money and profit i am trying to be generous and fair</p>
