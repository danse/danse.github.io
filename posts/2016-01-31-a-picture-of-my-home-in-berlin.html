<p>After two months in Italy and Sicily, as i arrived back to my small flat in Berlin i had a surprising feeling of familiarity and relaxation, as if the disposition of objects told a story that i was happy to listen.</p>
<p>While unpacking, i felt the need to make a video of the interiors, as i did in the past right before abandoning my preceeding homes. I don’t want to forget the nice small things that i gathered here, the simple lifestyle.</p>
<p>This was the first flat where i lived completely on my own and not conditioned by anybody. I see it as a bubble of loneliness and freedom, an experiment whose results are important to me, as i don’t know whether this will happen again in the future.</p>
<p>For a while, my life here seemed steady and consistent, and i was satisfied about it, but i was planning to strengthen my connection with my origins. I travelled and checked the possibilities, saying around that i was looking for a way back, but postponing decisions to when i would be back in Berlin. Now i can decide to stay here longer, it is comfortable, convenient and way easier now, and i like it.</p>
<p>Anyway, after my last trip, i feel different. I can see Berlin from the eyes of a nomad, and i might start weighing some anchors soon. Hence the need to take a snapshot, with a camera, or with these words.</p>
<p>I might write here what i consider precious and remarkable, but i prefer to live it through the upcoming days. I will leave time for thoughts and emotions to settle, in order to move with confidence.</p>
