<p>I am happy about the results achieved working on Crumbs. Now i enjoy the tool way more and it’s helping me a lot to balance activities during a working day.</p>
<p>The next project i’m going to work on today is <em>Gates</em>. I hope to come up with a lightweight system to store tagged information. The main use case at the moment is storing web locations, but i can imagine many applications, as this is a topic that i’ve been interested in for a while.</p>
<p>In the last months i’ve been storing information on my file system more often, as i work more online and use the web more. I still didn’t find a practical way to store but especially to manage tagged information, so i hope that Gates will provide me with a basic system and hopefully some helpful and simple tools.</p>
<p>I think that the problem is a complex one, so i might work on it just for a bit, find some satisficing solutions and write some documentation that can serve as a foundation for eventual development.</p>
<p>On the other hand, which kind of work could i do that can bring some economical outcomes? Maybe learn Clojure for Android? But then React Native would probably be a better technology for me to approach mobile. Mobile development could be fun, for a lot of reasons. I am also using mobile software way more now that i live as a nomad.</p>
<p>Maybe i could mix the two things, and write an offline mobile app to manage tagged information. So maybe the Gates project could be built for Android.</p>
<p>I have to install Android studio again. Every time i approached mobile dev, i was faced with proprietary technologies, which are not easily available for my system and are imposing some constraints on me. They make me feel like i’m wasting my time.</p>
<p>Yes, being a mobile dev could grant me some money on the short term, but i’m not sure that it’s bringing me where i want to be. I will peek again into this market full of capital and walled gardens eventually, as it’s really relevant for many users including myself, but i don’t want to give it priority for now, i want to give priority to things i care more about, open technologies like those that can be used on the web, or for backend systems, or for creative applications, or for system engineering</p>
