<p>I’m planning to work on my <em>Crumbs</em> project in the next days or
weeks. The project goal is not critical, but the set of technologies
is important for me at the moment.</p>
<p>I feel like being able to solve problems in that domain space (front
end) with those technologies (a strongly typed functional language
coupled with Javascript) would be both very satisfactory and a
catalyser for many development possibilities.</p>
<p>I would like to work on more meaningful projects with more impact, but
this seems to be what i’ve got, at the moment. Before loading more
items on my to-do pipeline, i want to get this old tasks and
challenges out of my way.</p>
