<p>the state of unsatisfaction i feel while starting to work on a ticket in my current project is excessive.</p>
<p>The project is going to finally end soon, but i come to think that i paid too much for this, probably i did a mistake at some point.</p>
<p>I thought that the time i spent studying could balance for any frustration. I thought that i could enjoy working on this project, maybe i was thinking that my cumulating unsatisfaction was unjustified. Maybe i have to rethink those assumptions. Some others proved right, and yielded some results for me, my colleagues, my client.</p>
<hr />
<p>Money had a role. In a context where i couldnâ€™t easily find new satisfying work opportunities, it felt suicidal to abandon a consolidated and fair collaboration, whose goals i shared.</p>
<p>The error in this attitude can be related to insecurity, and using money as an indicator for value. If i want to develop further my professionality, i need to understand better value beyond money. I can practice this principle immediately, looking for new clients on the base of value and not money.</p>
<p>I did this in the past and it led to an enriching but not fully positive experience. Now i feel like i learned a lessons or two, and i can give it another shot. In the last years i positioned myself the best i could, in order to keep investing in value rather than money</p>
