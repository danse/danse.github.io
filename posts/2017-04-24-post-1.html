<p>It’s the first time that nomading i decide to work from home. Until now i always organised myself in order to reach a coworking, but here for one week it was not worth it. Working from home gives me a fuzzy feeling and reminds me a lot of university. The day went differently than my usual working days, but it’s the night that impressed me and led me to write a new post.</p>
<p>It’s like when i was doing late nights, as a teenager, on the first web. It’s like many nights in Berlin. It’s my night, my computer, the shiny lights, the Internet, and the darkness around. I feel more paranoid, and at the same time more comfortable and aware, in my dark corner, watching the world through armless, flat pixels.</p>
<p>And it’s like many nights at University, and really many nights of my life. Before the Internet, games. Windows beyond reality.</p>
