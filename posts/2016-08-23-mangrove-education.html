<p>I have been learning a lot in the past days during the <a href="http://edu.meetmangrove.com/">Mangrove Education</a> event. These have been busy days and i definitely won’t have the time to turn my experiences in a consistent post. One of the key insights i got from Olivier, though, is the importance of having a commitment in publishing. I think that i need that, at least for a while, in order to become better at sharing my work and the results of my personal research. I might try to publish at least once a week. This week, my post will just consist in a few notes about what i learned.</p>
<p>I have been learning a lot, but i felt the need to take some notes just starting from the morning of the education day, while Svenia was talking about the outcomes of her world education tour.</p>

<h3 id="video-editing-by-max">Video editing by Max</h3>
<p>Knowing the editing before filming helps a lot. For example having the music in mind Max did long and short shots, collecting the elements which match the music.</p>
<p>Close ups. Focus on the guitar to focus on the guitar solo music.</p>
<p>Show different angles.</p>
<p>Keep directions.</p>
<p>Aggressive cuts. Remove esitation in talks. Somebody throwing the pillow, somebody catching the pillow, no trajectory.</p>
<p>Rhythm to support storytelling. The beat is the cut … long shots, short shots, can be synchronised with the music, for example a cut every four music beat, then every two beats, crescendo.</p>
<p>Audio synchro</p>
<p>Be wild</p>

<p>High achievers featured: - People talk the same amount of time in meetings - People were sensitive to others’ feelings - Psycological safety: people can show their weaknesses. A team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves</p>

<h5 id="twitter-mass-follow">Twitter mass follow</h5>
<p>We want to keep a balance between followed and not followed, so after some time people who do not follow back should be unfollowed. There is a simple extension but there are also better tools. Ideally we want to blacklist people that we already followed and unfollowed, in order not to spam then.</p>
<h5 id="from-followers-to-the-landing-page">From followers to the landing page</h5>
<p>New followers can be welcomed with a direct message. Pinned tweets. Then obviously the short description</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>It’s a quiet afternoon in the cosy innovation space at Betahaus. Many participants already left to catch their flight. Slight noises come from the few of us who still stay, every one of us in their frame, their device. The infinite possibility on the Internet are still on the other side of the screen, but i still feel that i cannot take distance easily from the experiences, the warmth and the sense of community and belonging.</p>
<p>I turn my time tracker off. I had not done that before this experience. How deeply did this experience change me? How much will i keep with me? And how much was i able to share?</p>
<p>Well before living this, i thought that i could hardly share some of my deepest thoughts and values with a community, but here maybe it happened. The openness and creativity, and the possibility to mix work on the body, work on the self, work on the product and work on society, this is also something i thought was impossible. I can still feel some dissonance, but i also feel like i just got a train to come closer to my destination, while before i was going by foot.</p>
<p>The creators of Mangrove are right. Loneliness is tough to deal with, and they found a way to attack loneliness, at least for some persons, at least for a while. I am looking forward to further developments</p>
