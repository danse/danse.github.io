<p>Despite i had little results, i’m going to try to invest a bit more on liquid work, which also means investing more in Upwork, mainly.</p>
<p>The directions are two: on one side, a bit of code to get some metrics out of my data, like my average rate per worked hour and my average worked hours. Then i could use that data with the Hyperbolic rating algorithm.</p>
<p>The other direction is analysing data coming from Upwork job offers, categorising by the amount of hours required per week … and possibly the due date.</p>
<p>I would like to invest two or three weeks into this, it should be enough to get something usable</p>
