<p>I just got set up in the Coworking in Cordova. This is my second nomad city, and i feel like i’m getting the hang of being a nomadic engineer. I feel quite energised and focused when starting the day, things start falling into place.</p>
<p>Yesterday night i worked very late, as i had insomnia. This made me recall the early days of my career, and how working late by myself made me conceive the ideas that brought me far in the development of the software i was in charge of.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of creative work i’m interested in doing, and that is part of what i was looking for when i started investing in remote work. Apparently it’s also something that happens spontaneously to me. School and office life was always against my nature.</p>
<p>It’s a weird feeling, the suitability of my current lifestyle. It seems an absurd lifestyle, unconfortable and senseless, but it’s resonating with me. I feel good, i am enjoying it, i’m thriving into it. It’s not perfect, but it feels right for me with its discomfort, its excitement, its weirdness, its uncertainty, its share of day dream.</p>
