<p>sometimes you pay the price for a job in advance, the day of your interview, and in an unexpected way.</p>
<p>you pay it in dreams. You come there with your bag of dreams, and you offer it to them. Will they buy it?</p>
<p>i don’t want to be negative, not all jobs are the same. Sometimes your dreams will be payed back to you, with all the interests.</p>
<p>some other times, your dreams are the only fuel that keeps the wrecked machine on the road. They will drip inside the gears, messily. They will do their flow, they won’t be back.</p>
<p>it can be worth the compromise. You can get other things in exchange. What’s important is to be aware, and maybe ready to react if your life is going in a direction you don’t want it to go</p>
