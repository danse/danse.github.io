<p>Anger is leaving room to reflection, frustration is leaving room to creativity. I am being held here by a system that i despise, but while i feel extraneous to that system i realise that i am already behaving as a nomad. I have to. The system is taking my material resources, i won’t allow it to take also my mental ones. I am starting to create again, i am finding my spaces again, i am outside from this all, whatever happens.</p>
<p>As a nomad i feel weaker and stronger at the same time, i feel just different, just like being elsewhere. The stark experience of the non-physicality of this difference is fascinating. I’m still here, but already elsewhere. Understanding this makes me feel free, and better.</p>
