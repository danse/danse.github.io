<p>Itâ€™s not easy for me now to get out of the state of tension, and that prevents me from thinking, from working like i want. I never had to get into this state in the first place. I found myself in similar situations other times, and often the solution is to pay more than usual, in order to get back to where you want to be. I already started paying more than usual for this, but itâ€™s still not enough. I can observe some improvements though, iâ€™ll keep trying.</p>
<p>How to approach this? ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>Building an idea to use as an entry point from outside the channels.</p>
<p>Actually i have no idea to build, i already have many ideas that are developing well within the new registry project. Writing about them can be helpful. The design document has been a breakthrough for me and eased the improvement of team collaboration by providing a simple reference for discussions. The software design is growing side by side with other domains of design, in continuous exchange also with the prototyping efforts. All of this in a remote team, with cultural differences and difficulties connecting to the Internet, and while working on the project for 8 hours per week.</p>
<p>We might soon close the circle of the first prototype, while we managed to distinguish what is uncertain from what can be the foundation for our product.</p>
<p>I did not save in personality in the last weeks, but currently i feel like the weak link, so i need to take care of myself. Iâ€™m making progress but i know that i might need a bit more time. I hope that the team will understand, so that we can keep building on what we have.</p>
<p>Before restoring the performance, i will have to restore the spirit, the attitude of my daily work.</p>
