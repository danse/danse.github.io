<p>Spent the whole day with my family, my creative brother here, so today i was motivated to abandon the usual techy topics and do something small for my site.</p>
<p>Now i can actually use clear fonts, so that even the post title will look clearer in the list. This is a prerequisite for writing something interesting for others to read, otherwise they would get lost among my personal notes.</p>
<p>Marsala wine is flowing here, and we are tired from the long day, but luckily i am using Haskell so code still works and gets better even though the brain is ready for surrender</p>
