<p>Wow, looking for work can be depressing. It shouldn’t be like that. This makes me whish i wouldn’t have to look for work. I guess that this is what happens to all of us: when we find work we like, we don’t want to go back to that state of uncertainty. This makes sense, but being motivated by fear is not what i want.</p>
<p>I guess that i should enjoy the uncertainty and leave the enjoyment guide myself towards new work. Anxiety can prevent me from spending too much time into activities that won’t lead me anywhere.</p>
<p>Too much anxiety is paralising though, and this is a bit how i feel now. I would like to bring back more enjoyment into job search, but i’m not sure how. Anyway, even just having that as a method can guide me through the alternatives, it’s helpful.</p>
