<p>This week is short in terms of worked hours but full of inspiration and insights, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>realising what was a keystone object in my habits at home</li>
<li>realising how much effort it takes me to keep working with tools i consider inadequate</li>
<li>thinking about unconventional way to redefine my relationship with Berlin, in a way that is not just stay or leave</li>
<li>adding cool new features to my job selection script</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, none of these led to writing yet, but today i have got inspired about something which is worth at least a quick note, before running out to the gorgeous evening Berlin is offering today.</p>
<p>I was casually chatting with someone in the Co Up lounge when i realised that the people around me had the same concerns about work i had. Before leaving the place, i’ve read a copy of “A cartoonist’s advice” from Bill Watterson hanging from a wall in the lounge. I realised that i am not the only person who is trying to live Berlin in a different way, and that i am surrounded by others probably more brave, visionary and ambitious than me.</p>
<p>This hint brings its contribution to my daily oscillation between two Lorenz attractors, and leaves me even more undecided about the future. Still, this is how i am living this week: every insight seems to be disruptive of something, but every time i seem to feel better, and stronger. This time, i feel less alone. Thanks Co Up.</p>
