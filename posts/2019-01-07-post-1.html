<p>i am deleting old files related to jobs i tried to do on upwork. i want to note how professional i was in approaching these projects where i had such a low chance of earning something. currently i am in a totally different position and attitude, so it strikes me to find out about that.</p>
<p>this is written very badly.</p>
<p>it’s a note for myself and, to an external reader, it can be revealing about how attitude can change over time, after one has invested good will and hopes they can somehow end for a while and need recharge.</p>
<p>this is also related to self esteem. once it has been consumed, one can think of being uncapable of things they did easily and often in the past.</p>
<p>the self esteem goes also towards clients and platforms. i had so many fucks to give at the time, even to upwork. it’s no longer the case.</p>
<p>the extent was wide, i also made some money, in the end it was probably not even that bad as an experience, the figures did not work, i was still trying it before the contract happened.</p>
<p>it’s also interesting how the files are here, separated, a sort of pre-wave. although i have low esteem of wave and everything at the moment, it seems relevant to me that the variety of application to upwork and lean files evolved into it.</p>
