<p>In a good coworking, interaction happen spontaneously and frequently. Otherwise it’s not a good coworking. One goes there in order to work with people, not to stay on one’s own.</p>
<p>Therefore studying in a good coworking is not easy, one gets distracted often, there isn’t much room for quiet.</p>
<p>I’m slowly realising that there are many reasons why it can be important to work and study at home, at times at least</p>
