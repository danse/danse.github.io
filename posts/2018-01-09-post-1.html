<p>i started writing at the computer in july when i managed to set a really comfortable environment for doing that in order to port an old habit from Vim to Emacs i tried writing bottom up, and i found it inspiring this summer in Soller when reasoning about priorities and change management i compared stacks with queues in some scenarios from that moment on i started developing the concept of stacks now i start using these concepts everywhere and the work done is helpful i’m impressed by how long-term has the work been and how deep, connecting so many aspects of using technology</p>
<p>it comes from concepts that i’ve been thinking about since the second year of university, and that started from the desire to generalise some concepts related to implementations of processors and computing</p>
<p>it also comes from decades-long experimenting and from a paper-based prototype which evolved out of simple practice, proved to be very effective, and was analysed better at the beginning of december</p>
<p>now it’s early to say whether this is something useful only to me or whether it can be explained and it can be helpful to others as well</p>
