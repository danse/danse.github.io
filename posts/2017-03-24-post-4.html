<p>one of the reasons i became a freelancer was to improve my professionality. Most of my efforts in the last year have been about expanding my pool of clients, but things did not go as expected. I ended up being rather static with my client, thus i need to update my metrics. I started a research meta issue about quality control. In practice this will probably turn into a conversation with my client, but i would like it to be assisted by data.</p>
<p>One of the metrics that interest me is the time per week, what is the client’s perception about it. Do they think that it’s too much, too little?</p>
<p>I am afraid that weekly time sharing might affect productivity. I need to verify this with my means and by asking the client’s feedback.</p>
