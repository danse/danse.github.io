<p>some theory turned into experience, and a lot of experience doesn’t have a theory any longer</p>
<p>laming hard, in order to keep my faster beats aligned with the slower</p>
<p>in order to keep the jumps of my ego too small to reach the fetish</p>
<p>and i can make it, i can carry the mountains with me, and the fire of my passion, under control</p>
<p>and i’m out of control</p>
<p>gliding close to the ground, ready to land</p>
<p>in a difficult exercise of integration</p>
<p>how to integrate the big with the small, the fast with the slow, the many with the few, the strong with the weak, the rich with the poor</p>
<p>freedom and respect, creativity and awareness?</p>
<p>just received a message from my love. how to? together</p>
