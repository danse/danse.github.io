<p>ibla feels like the final destination of my tour, the upcoming month a
short tail from which to start over again in the opposite direction</p>
<p>in some sense it doesn’t matter whether it’s a tail with poison or
not, it’s the tail and i’m directed there, to the bottom and back up,
or to the top and back down</p>
<p>if i will go to catania i could never experience ibla again, if i will
go to ibla it could take even more energy away from me and push me
even further on this path towards a deep personal change. i’m not
looking forward to change more, i’m just on this path and i’ve been
offered a last mile</p>
<p>in ibla are some migrants, the abandoned houses and the empty tourism,
the lost soul of this city, some friends, the nature, more loneliness,
more time to spend with my soul</p>
<p>in catania is the people and our blind energy, dirt, the streams that
disperse with generosity, but most of all a rising path again, some
action i’m craving, allies and a way out</p>
<p>i think it’s going to be catania, because i want to start gently
losing myself again, mix my waters to the winds and the seas. i had
enough connection and reconciliation, now movement leads me to another
direction</p>
<p>this is a good way to leave, balancing the goal with a warm
attachment. this transforms the dirt before i even move, and enables
me to look at it for what it is</p>
<p>finally i don’t care much, my fire slowly burns within</p>
