<p>I was way a worse programmer when i was a worse communicator, because a lot of coding is about communicating.</p>
<p>I realised this today reading a pull request. I never enjoyed reviewing pull requests, i just had to do it because it was effective and fruitful in a number of ways.</p>
<p>In the last months, living as a nomad made me a better communicator, and now i’m seeing the impact on my profession. This impact is more subtle that i had imagined.</p>
<p>So today, when reviewing a pull request, suddently i was struck by a different perspective on code. I always considered code to be something between me, or its author, and the machine. Suddently i saw the code as a way for the team to communicate internally, and that made me perform my review in a totally different way, which felt way more natural and effective.</p>
<p>We are told that programmers are bad communicators, mad scientists which are allowed to behave sometimes in rather inhuman ways. Our culture justifies that, so that we don’t see much dissonance.</p>
<p>Almost ten years ago while studying mechanical engineering i started learning about the importance of communication in science, math and engineering, but it sounds like i still have a lot to learn</p>
