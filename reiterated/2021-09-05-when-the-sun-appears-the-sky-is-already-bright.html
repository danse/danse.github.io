            <blockquote>
<p>we found ourselves in the wrong place at the wrong time and loneliness is a cradle and the endless night welcomes its rhythm our eyes wouldn’t close, while our soul found a roof clearly we didn’t count the hours because our dark cover is now leaving us exposed</p>
<p>when a slow conflict fires the sky slowly light flows everywhere birds sing, fishes populate the sea everything is so quiet now, it’s already day and the sun is still not there</p>
<p>maybe we don’t care about it after all our sky is all ready for a new boring day when some clouds start looking funny strokes of light catch our eye on them then they blur, then they expand we tought the sky was bright, but it keeps changing the light we didn’t expect keeps glowing it starts feeling glorious, and the sun is still not there</p>
<p>now we don’t really need it this is everything we wanted we found ourselves at the other end of society at the other end of our wandering exhausted and surprised, we realise this day is ours and the sun</p>
