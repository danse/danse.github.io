            <h1>cultural features</h1>

            <p>if we consider culture like a good that can be duplicated, having adoption as its mean of survival</p>
<p>then the culturally winning features of an identity end up freeing themselves and becoming unidentifiable features</p>
<p>the path to losing the feature’s identity is part of the feature’s identity, as such it is diverse, but it needs to end into communicability, and communicability is very powerful and dangerous</p>
<p>maybe this is why we can sometimes spot dare or ambition in winning cultures</p>
<p>being negative about the diffusion of an identifying feature defines its limit</p>
