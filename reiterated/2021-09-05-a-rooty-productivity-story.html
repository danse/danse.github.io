            <h1>a rooty productivity story</h1>

            <p>what does it mean to be productive today? how to be, what’s the best option i have in order to be</p>
<p>after relaxing, suddently i remember my ambitious goal, and that gives direction to the whole productivity effort which seemed to be in a stall. avevo perso di vista la mia visione e ciò mi rendeva meno efficace, privo di direzione</p>
<p>i found it back while asking what did it mean to me to be productive today. when did i lose it? i think when i started studying Hofstadter’s book. that effort drained up all other efforts</p>
<p>and now i like a public space better, but i can look for the space suited to the task</p>
<p>in preparation to today i had the idea of applying microdevelopment to my vision</p>
<p>tool level strategy shift, maybe opwer-analyses was already there</p>
<p>yeah! the missing link is getting very short!</p>
<p>is it a sweet spot?</p>
<p>extend to everybody</p>
<p>it’s not flow, but it’s direction … and seeding. not as intentional as anchoring. it’s a sweet spot in some sense but not yet in all senses … it feels productive</p>
<p>got interruption by something else … branching</p>
<p>it’s giving me a flow of emotions</p>
<p>i don’t feel like it’s going to make me productive. branching back</p>
<p>i think that people would be interested in skills and categories</p>
<p>interferences from the closed branch</p>
<p>add categories to the job profile and the exported data</p>
<pre><code>      &quot;op_job_category_v2&quot; : {
         &quot;op_job_category_v&quot; : {
            &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Scripts &amp; Utilities&quot;,
            &quot;groups&quot; : {
               &quot;group&quot; : {
                  &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Web, Mobile &amp; Software Dev&quot;,
                  &quot;uid&quot; : &quot;531770282580668418&quot;
               }
            }
         }
      },
      &quot;op_pref_hourly_rate_max&quot; : &quot;&quot;,
      &quot;buyer&quot; : {</code></pre>
<p>a lot of things i could do, but chasing the shortest link</p>
<p>so it’s done, it’s published. earlier than i could myself expect. this embodies a series of principles. let’s see how it’ll go</p>
<p>no effect. such lack of effect that it feels like void, thumbleweed, and it’s funny … but i was productive, so i want to go on with this. it worked in a few days and while doing other things, and it had the potential to be useful for someone. this matters to me</p>
<p>i liked surfacing potential productivity with the upwork data, i’ll look for more</p>
<p>there is learn and refine, this time it makes more sense. yeah in the data this is massive, i’m just not sure about refine being the shortest link here</p>
<p>finalising the pull request turned out to be more interesting than i expected</p>
