            <h1>postmortem summer 2017</h1>

            <p>Since when i started nomading my approach to work changed more and
more. Then after nowhere i was challenging my most fundamental habits.</p>
<p>Travelling through peripherical places in the middle of summer, also
my technologies and logistics were challenged to a point where i could
collect only a small amount of productive hours.</p>
<p>In these conditions, i started working for two clients simultaneously
for two projects that were rather challenging in very different ways.
I refused to be stressed, but couldnâ€™t avoid being somehow stressed.</p>
<p>I reacted and recovered, and i learned that my productivity was below
my own expectations. I consider my contribution to one of those
projects successful, and my contribution to the other project
unsuccessful.</p>
