<h3 id="an-unique-challenge">an unique challenge</h3>
<p>this gave me the opportunity to explore our limits, and push my profession beyond my comfort zone</p>
<div class="incremental">
<p>haskell didn’t let me down</p>

<div class="incremental">
<ul>
<li><code>jgm/pandoc</code> a rather powerful tool with a global community of users</li>
<li><code>italia/docs-italia-comandi-conversione</code> an interface for Italy</li>
<li><code>italia/docs-italia-pandoc-filters</code> details, or a framework for Italy</li>
</ul>
<div class="notes">
<p>it’s rather succinct work. it aims at design transparency by being immediate and sometimes intentionally raw, like in the documentation of the commands which are also notes for the next developer. this style enables easy sharing which could produce more noise than signal and a good way to find out is to ask new users. the documentation corpus has also been flux, and it’s now quickly crystallising for a development break</p>

<h3 id="innovation-from-working-software">innovation from working software</h3>
<p>the journey started by simply <em>hammering pandoc here and there to fix this and this</em></p>
<div class="incremental">
<p>as a small half-remote team we where all busy on multiple fronts so i learned to browse a broad scope through my specific expertise</p>
</div>
<div class="incremental">
<p>i found out how starting from a successful piece of software can be more impactful than greenfield projects</p>

<h3 id="connecting-seas">connecting seas</h3>
<p>innovation rooted on the existing is like connecting seas, turbulences feel chaotic and dangerous</p>

<h3 id="software-as-an-object-in-an-highly-dimensional-space">software as an object in an highly dimensional space</h3>
<p>code grows towards many goals, expanding on multiple dimensions is avoided in agile, where the priority direction shifts over time</p>
<p>in a context of political uncertainty, the problem has not been to self-organise, but to manage and communicate a value whose definition changes over time</p>
<h3 id="do-you-want-spanning-cells">do you want spanning cells?</h3>
<ul>
<li>user call close to the beginning of the project</li>

<h3 id="how-do-we-engineer-software">how do we engineer software?</h3>
<ul>
<li>like a plant, perfectly integrated in a rather stable environment</li>
<li>like a packet, cyclically delivered at the user’s devices</li>
<li>like a ship, whose use depends higly on the pilots and the territory</li>
<li>like a virus, whose success is defined by replication</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-journey-with-code">a journey with code</h2>
<h3 id="evolutionary-prototyping-a-ship">evolutionary prototyping a ship</h3>
<p>i leaned on haskell’s quality for refactorings and it enabled me to react swiftly and focus on the domain more than on the structure</p>
<p>prototyping makes little assumptions about what can we do, relying on user testing in order to collect proofs of concept. for many users a process of evolutionary prototyping is a new experience, and in a public context we want to manage expectations carefully</p>
<div class="notes">
<p>one area where the technology fell short has been deployment, where top-down design reacted faster</p>
</div>
<h3 id="integral-features">integral features</h3>
<p>a piece of software can move through different balance points in the space of its integral features</p>
<p>every dimension implies opportunities and tradeoffs</p>
