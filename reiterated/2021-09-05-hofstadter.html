            <h1 id="what-is-recursion-127">what is recursion? 127</h1>
<p>nesting and variations on nesting</p>
<p>a recursive definition always defines something
in terms of a simpler version of itself</p>
<p>one of the most common ways in which recursion appears in daily life
is when you postpone completing a task
in favor of a simpler task
often of the same type</p>
<h1 id="pushing-popping-and-stacks-128">pushing, popping and stacks 128</h1>
<p>basic terminology of recursion in computer science:
push, pop and push-down stack
introduced in the late 50’s as part of IPL
one of the first languages for artificial intelligence</p>
<p>to push means to suspend operations on the task you’re currently working on
without forgetting where you are
and to take up a new task</p>
<p>to pop is the reverse
close operations on one level
and resume operations where left off one level deeper</p>
<h1 id="stacks-in-music-129">stacks in music 129</h1>
<p>we maintain a mental stack of keys
and each new modulation pushes a new key into the stack
we want to hear the sequence of keys retracted in reverse order
until the tonic is reached
this is an exaggeration</p>
<p>any reasonably musical person automatically maintains a shallow stack
with two keys, the tonic and the pseudotonic</p>
<p>a local resolution should heighten the global tension rather than relieving it
because it is a piece of irony
tension and resolution are the hearth and soul of music</p>
<h1 id="bottoming-out-and-heterarchies-133">bottoming out and heterarchies 133</h1>
<p>indirect recursion</p>
<p>there can be a whole family of networks which are all tangled up
calling each other and themselves</p>
<p>a program which has such a structure
in which there is no single “highest level” or “monitor”
is called a heterarchy</p>
<p>term due to warren mcculloch</p>
<h1 id="recursion-and-unpredictability-152">recursion and unpredictability 152</h1>
<p>for a set to be recursively enumerable
means that it can be generated from a set of starting elements
by repeated application of rules of inference</p>
<p>thus the set grows
each new element being compounded out of previous elements</p>
<p>this is the essence of recursion
defining in terms of simpler versions
instead of explicitly</p>
<p>recursive enumeration is a process in which
new things emerge from old things by rules</p>
<p>it might seem that
some types of recursively defined sequences
exhibit increasing complexity of behavior
so that the further you go the less predictable they get</p>
<h1 id="language-as-an-activator-628">language as an activator 628</h1>
<p>(original title “the structure of shrdlu by winograd”, 628)</p>
<p>all language use can be though of as
a way of activating procedures within the hearer</p>
<p>we can think of any utterance as a program
one that indirectly causes a set of operations to be carried out
within the hearer’s cognitive system</p>
<p>this program writing is indirect in the sense that
we are dealing with an intellingent interpreter
who may take a set of actions which are quite different
from those the speaker intended</p>
<h1 id="creativity-and-randomness-673">creativity and randomness 673</h1>
<p>creativity is the essence of what is not mechanical
yet every creative act is mechanical</p>
<p>when programs cease to be transparent to their creators
the approach to creativity has begun</p>
<p>the world is a giant heap of randomness
we can mirror some of it inside our heads</p>
